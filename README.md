# OF
A small SuperCollider framework that consists of four main process categories: 
* Synthesis processes with dynamic waveform generation
* Atomic sound transformations that adapt to incoming signals
* Operation pipelines and algorithms to control and generate them
* Direct access, observers and reactions for content-based triggers and actions
